    </h2>
    <p class="grid-item2 text-center" style="width:50%;align-content:center; justify-content:center;margin-left:325px;">Our team believes that knowledge only comes to those who seek it and asking questions is the first step toward erudition. By combining the first letter of our team members’ first names (T for Tuan, A for Anh, and Q for Quynh), we have TAQ, our team name, which also stands for “Time to Ask Questions”. The spirit behind this name is to promote and encourage others to be curious and not afraid to ask questions because that is when they have the potential to master what they want to learn.</p>

                    I am Nguyen Thanh Tuan, a member of the TAQ team and a current student at RMIT University Vietnam. My student number is 3836455. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city. In 2014, I travelled to the United States of America for higher education. However, things didn't go as planned so I came back and applied to RMIT University Vietnam to continue my studies. I am majoring in Information Technology. I actually studied Business for a while when I was living in the States. During that time, my host family sparkled the love of IT in me when he taught and guided me through the process of building my own computer. After my first build, I decided to officially switch my major to IT and dig deeper into it. I figured out that I am really into Networking, Cyber Security, and Database/Server. Although I don’t have a lot of experience in the IT field beside some knowledge about computers, and codings, I am eager to learn more and make a career out of it, or even a business. During my free time, I love to hang out with friends; it can be anything from getting a cup of coffee, travelling with our bikes, or even playing video games together.

                <p class="text-center">
                    My name is Ky Anh, member of the TAQ team, first year student of RMIT in Saigon campus and my major is IT. Therefore, I was studying International Business at Hanoi campus. When finishing the first semester, I found out that business doesn't suit me well so I changed the course. Having known that I had interest in technologies and the Internet, I decided to move to Saigon campus without hesitation. In the Information Technology area, things that attract me the most are Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Technologies. Furthermore, when seeing these things, the first thought in my mind is “what features does it have and what can it do?”. I always wanted to try new technologies not with speech from the others but by my own hands, because by interacting directly with these technologies I can easily memorize their features and how to manipulate them. Nevertheless, besides the love for technologies, I also have some IT experience when I have not graduated from my high school. At this time, the school itself has organized a science fair at the school hall. This fair includes all students from different ages to participate, by forming in a group of 5 members and creating an invention of their own, this could be anything but most students chose to make a robot instead. Therefore, our group has invented a robot that can pick up items by using a controller but unfortunately it only can move around but cannot pick up items nearby.

               <p class="text-center">
                   Hi , My name is Quynh but you can also call me Lam, I am a freshman at RMIT and my student ID is s3836322. I am the third member of the TAQ team. So let's talk a little bit about myself. Firstly, I was born on a very--very special day, which is Women's National Day. Sadly, I just have one gift on this day. Secondly, as you can see in my name, I was born in Vietnam. However, I can speak English too thanks to my parents because they made me learn English at a very young age. Thirdly, there is one fun fact about me : my brother and also my cousins used to call me “Quan”, which means trouser in Vietnamese, because my name has a similar pronunciation. Moreover, in my free time, I love reading books and learning new things in different aspects such as marketing, business, etc. If you ask what my interest in IT is, it is definitely AI. I have a huge passion for AI because I am a lazy person and with the help of AI, my work will be completely faster and more efficient. To make my dream come true, I have studied some courses relevant to AI and machine learning on LinkedLearn. Moreover, I have attended many classes to learn about algorithms and data structure. Furthermore, to expand my knowledge in this field, I have read many books relevant to to AI, machine learning and data
