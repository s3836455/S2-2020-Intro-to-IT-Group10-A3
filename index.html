    <p class="grid-item2 text-center" style="width:50%;align-content:center; justify-content:center;margin-left:325px;">Our team believes that knowledge only comes to those who seek it and asking questions is the first step toward erudition. By combining the first letter of our team members’ first names (T for Tuan, A for Anh, and Q for Quynh), we have TAQ, our team name, which also stands for “Time to Ask Questions”. The spirit behind this name is to promote and encourage others to be curious and not afraid to ask questions because that is when they have the potential to master what they want to learn.</p>

                    I am Nguyen Thanh Tuan, a member of the TAQ team and a current student at RMIT University Vietnam. My student number is 3836455. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city. In 2014, I travelled to the United States of America for higher education. However, things didn't go as planned so I came back and applied to RMIT University Vietnam to continue my studies. I am majoring in Information Technology. I actually studied Business for a while when I was living in the States. During that time, my host family sparkled the love of IT in me when he taught and guided me through the process of building my own computer. After my first build, I decided to officially switch my major to IT and dig deeper into it. I figured out that I am really into Networking, Cyber Security, and Database/Server. Although I don’t have a lot of experience in the IT field beside some knowledge about computers, and codings, I am eager to learn more and make a career out of it, or even a business. During my free time, I love to hang out with friends; it can be anything from getting a cup of coffee, travelling with our bikes, or even playing video games together.

                <p class="text-center">
                    My name is Ky Anh, member of the TAQ team, first year student of RMIT in Saigon campus and my major is IT. Therefore, I was studying International Business at Hanoi campus. When finishing the first semester, I found out that business doesn't suit me well so I changed the course. Having known that I had interest in technologies and the Internet, I decided to move to Saigon campus without hesitation. In the Information Technology area, things that attract me the most are Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Technologies. Furthermore, when seeing these things, the first thought in my mind is “what features does it have and what can it do?”. I always wanted to try new technologies not with speech from the others but by my own hands, because by interacting directly with these technologies I can easily memorize their features and how to manipulate them. Nevertheless, besides the love for technologies, I also have some IT experience when I have not graduated from my high school. At this time, the school itself has organized a science fair at the school hall. This fair includes all students from different ages to participate, by forming in a group of 5 members and creating an invention of their own, this could be anything but most students chose to make a robot instead. Therefore, our group has invented a robot that can pick up items by using a controller but unfortunately it only can move around but cannot pick up items nearby.

                   Hi , My name is Quynh but you can also call me Lam, I am a freshman at RMIT and my student ID is s3836322. I am the third member of the TAQ team. So let's talk a little bit about myself. Firstly, I was born on a very--very special day, which is Women's National Day. Sadly, I just have one gift on this day. Secondly, as you can see in my name, I was born in Vietnam. However, I can speak English too thanks to my parents because they made me learn English at a very young age. Thirdly, there is one fun fact about me : my brother and also my cousins used to call me “Quan”, which means trouser in Vietnamese, because my name has a similar pronunciation. Moreover, in my free time, I love reading books and learning new things in different aspects such as marketing, business, etc. If you ask what my interest in IT is, it is definitely AI. I have a huge passion for AI because I am a lazy person and with the help of AI, my work will be completely faster and more efficient. To make my dream come true, I have studied some courses relevant to AI and machine learning on LinkedLearn. Moreover, I have attended many classes to learn about algorithms and data structure. Furthermore, to expand my knowledge in this field, I have read many books relevant to to AI, machine learning and data

           In general, our group did fine when working together in Assignment 2. Here are some good tactics in Assignment 2, that are used again in the Assignment 3:
       </div>
       <br />
       <div>
           <b>Subjective:</b>
       </div>
       <ul>
           <li>
               Schedule bonding time to let team members understanding each others and helps them get out of their “comfort zone”, so the team can maximize the outcome of the project
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>

           <li>
               Letting members choose their tasks before assigning them.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               Getting to know other members’ schedules and their life outside of school work to sympathize and support if bad things happen.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
       </ul>
       <div>
           <b>Objective:</b>
       </div>
       <ul>
           <li>
               The tasks are split and assigned equally and fairly among team members.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>

           <li>
               Each task will have its own deadline as we also consider the workload of each task differently.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               The deadlines are set a little sooner than when they should be to create courage for team members to finish the task and also give them the feelings they have extra time in case the deadlines are not met.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               Each task will be assigned based on team members’ skills, experiences, and knowledges about that tasks
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>

           <li>
               One can join and support other team members on a task if they want to learn more about that particular task.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               When finished, tasks are reviewed by other members to not only improve the quality of the finished tasks, but also its synergy with others’ works.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
       </ul>
       <div>
           On the other hand, we also have some bad practices that need to be fixed. Here are those bad practices and our solutions:
       </div>
       <br />
       <div>
           <b>Subjective:</b>
       </div>
       <ul>
           <li>
               Miscommunications happened due to busy schedules, which resulted in stress and delays - Spending more time checking on each other to minimize miscommunications.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               Procrastination happened due to many reasons - Schedule working time offline so all members can gather together and encourage each other to work
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>

On the other hand, Quynh’s ideal job - AI/Data Mining Developer requires her to “perform functional analysis, application design, development, unit test, deployment and maintenance”. Despite the differences, our group believes that data is the common element between Tuan and Quynh’s jobs.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data is involved heavily in both Tuan and Quynh’s jobs. As a Database Administrator, Tuan has to work a lot with data since it is his job to keep the company’s database performing sufficiently to “ensure the availability and consistent performance of our corporate applications”
                   . On the other hand, as a AI/Data Mining Developer, Quynh needs the data to perform her tasks as data is important for AI to train test units or models. In other words, Tuan keeps the database functional for Quynh, so she can use the data for her AI’s tasks.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, one could say that Tuan and Anh’s jobs have a common background. Since both Tuan (Database Administrator) and Anh (System Developer) are required to maintain, improve and troubleshoot the system they are assigned to; they are, technically, doing the same job but in different segments of IT, with different focuses.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Assignment 2, none of our team members change their ideal jobs. Despite the fact that most of our team members’ ideal jobs are not in the top demanding jobs and other criterias, we chose those ideal jobs as we have a passion in those particular fields and we also want to build our careers relating to those jobs. So, it is important to work a couple years in these positions and gain enough experiences and confidence before setting foot into building our careers. Not only that, these jobs can also be a testing place for us to test ourselves to make sure that we are passionate and determined enough for the actual investment in those fields.

               <p class="text-center">
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Tuan, with his interest in Networking, Database, and Cyber Security, within the next 5 years, he plans to study on his own thoroughly most of the coding languages for those fields like C, C++, Java, Python, and so on. He also plans to intern at relevant companies to strengthen his skills and experiences. If possible, he also wants to get his Master’s degree right after he graduates from RMIT. After that, he would love to work for around 5 years with some self-study of general business/finance to prepare for the next big step. His biggest goal, at this moment, is to start up a cloud/server/database solution company with his best friend who is majoring in Finance and Logistics.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anh, he does not have a clear career plan for himself yet. At the moment, he wants to strengthen his coding skills with Java, Python, HTML, and CSS within the next 5 years. He also wants to study Linux and Windows Server. On the other hand, he plans to also study some business courses to improve his skills in finance.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Quynh sets her goals to be an expert in the field of AI/Machine Learning. She plans to apply for an internship during her second year of internship to gain more experiences. She is also in the progress of self-study of AI, Machine Learning, and AWS on LinkedLearn. She wants to gain enough knowledge and experiences to start researching furthermore on the topic of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning with a focus on some topics like facial recognition/detection, AI chat bot, and so on.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up the analysis for our group’s career plans, each of us has our own plans and paths for the future. At the present, since our group’s members are still in our first or second year in college, it is certain that we still have a lot to learn and experience to prepare for whatever we plan in the future, at least for the next 2 to 3 years. After this period, it is when the difference starts to kick in. For Anh, he isn’t sure about what he wants to do next, after his college life. For Tuan, he wants to start up a company with his friend that provides cloud/server/database solutions for others; while, on the other hand, Quynh wants to go deeper into the field of AI/Machine Learning.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Assignment 2, most of the team members from the TAQ Team still stay with their original career plans. For example, Tuan still aims to open a Database/Servers solution company or anything similar in that field, with his best friend. However, he is now aware more about the presence of BlockChain and other jobs related to his IT interest, like Data Analyst, or Business Intelligence. He said that he would look into those things when he had the time. For Quynh, she still stays with her IT interest in Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence. Lastly, for Anh, he is still undecided on his career paths in the future. However, he knows he likes what he is studying now.

           <b>Brief description on work:</b>
           <br />
           <p>
               In the tutorial, we have learn 2 ways push code on Github which is using collboration or using fork ways. Our team decided to use colloration ways. At first, our leader - Tuan created the repository for our group on Github and then invite others members to this repository so they can edit and pull the code.
               <br />
               <br />
               At first we did the code on our computer and then combined it to one file. Then, we choosed one day which is the day near deadline to push the code together.  Therefore, it would reduce the mistakes and errors during the process of pulling the code to Github. For CSS and images, Tuan, the leader, will push it to Github.
           </p>
           <b>Comment on the Github repository:</b>
           <ul>
               <li>
                   All team members have attributed and push their code to the Github well
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
               <li>
                   All the commit messsages are written in great detail so others member could know which part had been done and which part had not
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
               <li>
                   While looking at the history of the repository, the date we push all code was quite closed to each other because we planned to push our code in one day together to reduce errors and mistakes while pushing it to Github
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
               <li>
                   Due to some unexpected technical issues, Ky Anh's laptop went out before the session of pushing our code to Github. As the team leader, Tuan advised him to use Tuan's laptop together with him. Each commit by Ky Anh will be noted differently to confirm that he actually did the commit. The team leader will also send the professor an email about this matter with a video about this issue as a proof.
                   <br />
                   <br />

            <b>Topic:</b>
            <br />
            <p>
                <b>Overview:</b> Our project consists of 2 sections which are the technical part and non-technical part and in each section, there will be more parts of it. For the technical part, there are 6 sections which we propose to do. The first section is the login system, the second is the quiz/survey/questionnaires, the third part is online chat services, the fourth part is online interpreter, the fifth part is online judging tool and the final part is the forum. For the non-technical part, there are 4 sections that we intend to do. The first part is creating the video/tutorial/ excersice/ pet project content, the second part is designing illustration/ images, the third part is recruitment services and the final part is Hackathon/ Competition
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Outcome:</b> If CodeX is successful, there might be more and more people working in the IT industry which meet the requirement of this career for the next 10 years. Therefore, the IT industry in Vietnam will be developed and reach a position that could be compared to other developed countries such as China, America, Russia, etc. Consequently, robots for housework which helps saving time, self-driving cars which are very useful for those who do not know to drive cars, virtual assistants like Jarvis in Marvel movies to arrange your work,.. those things in the next 5 years might be common in Vietnam. Finally, with those services made in Vietnam, it can be bought from other countries which can bring benefits to Vietnam’s economic efficiency.
            </p>

            2.
            <b>Motivation:</b>
            <br />
            <p>
                We are now standing on the brick of four industrial revolutions. Therefore, the demand for computer and information technology has been currently increasing. According to VietNam’s News, Viet Nam needs more than 400,000 information technology (IT) in 2020 and this number will become greater for the next 10 years. Not all Vietnamese people have the chance to study English so learning through video tutorials or reading documents is quite hard for them to understand especially for the young. This application will be an essential tool for the start of exploring the IT world. Moreover, for those who want to change their career path to IT or lost basic knowledge about IT, CodeX provides many courses which take 3-4 hours to help them keep back on track.
            </p>
            <br />
            3.
            <b>Landscape:</b>
            <br />
            <p>
                Since CodeX is a part of EdTech, we have a lot of opponents including domestic and foreign competitors. Firstly, for international competitors, they have a lot of tech education websites such as FreeCodeCamp - the website providing the free education with the online interpreter, Codecademy - they provided many courses with lots of exercise, tutorial videos and the interface’s design of the website is quite attractive and easy to use, Coursera - the website that hosting the content from the top university which include more than 1000+ quality programming course. For domestic opponents, we have CodeLearn.io, the website has an online interpreter and the exercise that users can practice without downloading any software such as Visual Studio Code. All this application we have mentioned compared to our project has a lot in common such as an online interpreter, videos tutorial, forum, hackathon, competition, etc. However, two things make our website stand out more than others. Firstly, we have a recruitment system. After finishing relevant courses in CodeX (the candidates must reach our qualifications), our services will connect you to many companies. We will be the one that supports you to find jobs and prepares for you before the interview. Secondly, we have the mentors community who will guide you know what to do, what to learn if you do not know where to begin. Besides that, they will review your code, find out why you get the mistake and explain it to you through the given exercise. Overall, two of the features of CodeX that make it different from others is our recruitment services and mentor community.

            </h2>
            <section class="grid-item2">

                <div>
                    According to
                    <a href="https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/518135/vn-to-lack-400000-it-workers-by-2020.html">Viet Nam News</a>, the Information Technology (IT) industry’s demand for IT workers in Vietnam will reach an outstanding number of 400,000 by the year of 2020. If this prediction is valid, there will be a surge of people who want to study or switch their career paths to IT. With that in mind, our aim is to create a web-based platform that provides excellent education and after-study activities about coding and programming (we believe this is the gateway to IT) with a focus on Vietnamese users. In order to achieve our aim, we have to set a list of specific goals that we have to fulfil.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    Firstly, due to inadequate skills or lack of foreign language education (English), it is important for us to support our Vietnamese users with both English and Vietnamese for deeper understanding of the content they are studying. This goal requires us to have not only a good understanding of our content but also good English skills, as we have to deliver the content in both English and Vietnamese without altering the meaning of our contents. For this goal, we may need the help and advice from English language experts to accomplish it.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    Secondly, we would love to have an online programming language compiler on our website. The ability to not only learn the content but also try and execute it right away is important to us. Our team is aware of the existence of many free, both online and offline compilers out there. However, we still want to have our own online compiler integrated in our website for the convenience of our users.

                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    Another goal of our team is to provide good after-study activities for our users like quizzes, mentorings, projects, competitions, connections, and so on. These after-study activities aim to strengthen the understanding of users on the content the project provides. These activities also give them more hands-on experience and prepare them for the real-world IT industry. For example, by forming teams with other users and participating in competitions, users have the chance to apply the knowledge they learn to solve real-world problems. As attending competitions is one of many good ways that helps users prove their abilities, it secures the chance in landing their dream jobs and strengthening their career paths.

                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    As our project’s main focus is the users in Vietnam, providing a Vietnamese content for this platform is a must-have. If things do not go as planned, we will go out of our way to make sure that this feature is fulfilled as our main focus is to help coding and programming reach as many Vietnamese people as possible.

            <section class="grid-item2">

                <!--Story section-->
                <div>
                    Although we decided to have CodeX as our group project, the original story behind CodeX is from Quynh’s idea after years of coding/programming self-study. Quynh shared with us that the free and available content for learning programming languages online is really good and helpful; however, there is still room for improvements. As most of the well-known web applications in this category are in English, it is really hard for Vietnamese users, especially those who do not have proper English skills but really want to study coding and programming. This creates a big barrier for them, and in results, limiting the number of users in this category. Even for Quynh, who has adequate English skills in general, she still has trouble understanding the concepts and languages during her self-study time. As Vietnam is entering its 4.0 technology era, even more and more people will think about applying for a job in the IT industry and CodeX is her and our group’s answer to that demand.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Our project would be a web application called CodeX that could help users in Vietnam learn how to code and program. This application will provide many walkthrough tutorials to learn different programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, etc. Moreover, at the end of each session, to know if the users understand what they have learned, CodeX will provide several quizzes to help users remember the course easier. Besides that, it will have many mentors available for you to ask how to start coding, which is the best language for you to learn. Moreover, you can match with somebody that starts the same program path as you. Therefore, you can learn something new from others and tell them about what you have learned because one of the best ways to learn something is teaching it to somebody else. If you finish our tutorials, there are many challenges or pet projects to do as practice makes perfect.

                    <p>
                        CodeX will be written using mainly HTML, CSS and Javascript. However, to discuss deeply in how we develop this application, there are many things we have to do and we will separate it into 2 categories which are the root  (mainly about the technical stuff) and the interface (design, content stuff,etc.)
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        After our group has agreed on the topic for our project, we jumped right into researching the features for web application CodeX. Here the 10 features we want for our project:

Therefore, there are two things we have to do: making the login/ logout/ register session and connect it to our database
                        <br />

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        According to the Tutorial Republic in “PHP MySQL Login Systems”, there are 2 sections and in each section, there are some steps we need to follow:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>

                            <br />

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Create the database with the name “users”. Then create the table with the name “users_information” which contains the following attributes such as user_id, name, password, emai.
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 2:</b> Creating the config file
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                After creating the table, we will then use PHP script as below to connect to our MySQL database servers
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\login\2.png" />
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 3:</b> Making the Register form
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Firstly, we will make the basic form using HTML and CSS like below
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\login\signup.png" />
                                <br />
                                Then we made the PHP code that helps users to register by themselves. Moreover, this script can generate errors and notify it to them such as registering with the existing address, the email not valid, the password is easy to predict, etc.
                                <br />
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                <b>Building the Login System</b>
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 1:</b> Creating the login form
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Firstly, we make the basic login form using HTML and CSS
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\login\login.png" />
                                <br />
                                Then we make the PHP script to check if the user’s login information is fulfilled. If it meets those requirements, the code will execute the query and find the information that the user filled. If it is matched, we will store the user_id in session and redirect users to the homepage.

                                <br />
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 2:</b> Adding some code in the homepage
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If people redirect to the homepage if they successfully login into the account. However, we have to check again to check if the user logged in since with some case, the users may go directly into the homepage without accessing
                                <br />

                            </div>
                            <br />

                                <br />
                                When the user clicks on the "sign out" button, the script will be called to destroy the session and redirect the user to the login page
                                <br />
                                <br />

                        <b>Brief description:</b>After the tutorial, the users have to do some quizzes. In each quiz, the users will be given 4 options and just one is correct. Depending on what users choose, there will be a notification if they are right or wrong. After finishing all the quizzes for the lessons, it will display how many times that users choose the correct one toward the total quizzes given. This method will be implemented in the survey and questionnaires also. The way we make the content for the quiz will be mentioned in the “Interface and the process” section
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        According to the “Building the Simple Quiz” by “Chris Coyier”, there are 2 steps:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <div>
                            <b>Step 1: </b> Making the HTML script for the platform of the quizzes

                            All the questions have to be contained in the form tag

                        <br />
                        <div>
                            Quizzes are the list of questions. Therefore, for each question, it will be wrapped in the li tag and it will look like this
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            <br />

                        <div>
                            At the end of the form, we have to include the submit button

                            <br />

                            First, we create the “grade.php” file. In this file, we have to grab the value that has been POSTed. We take that value and check if it is a correct answer and if it does, we increase the number of correct answers. Finally, we will display the result at the end using a div tag.

                            </div>

                                In this CSS file, we will decorate our chatbox, changing the font style, the colour, etc. We will display as below
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\chat\1.jpg" />
                                <br />

                                First, we will create the database “chatting”. Secondly, we create the table named “chat_message” with the following attributes: id, name, message and date. Finally, we go to PHPMyAdmin, past our code on it and execute the queries.
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                After creating the login.php as we have mentioned, we will create the chat.php file which has two main functions: acceptMessage (accept sending the message and then store it in the database) and getMessage (return the list of 15 messages or more depending on your setting)
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Then, we make the message.php file which will generate the list of recent messages and the list will be refreshed every 5 seconds.
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                We will find and connect with the third-party services providing the online compiler and IDE like Programiz, Ideone, Replit, etc. This requires us to meet them and have a discussion with them. Therefore, we may have to prepare some paperwork relevant to the license and copyright.

                            According to “Online Compiler in Nodejs” by “IQ.OpenGenius.org”, there are a total of 4 steps to create the online compiler:

                                <br />
                                <br />

                                We will create the basic HTML and CSS script for doing the platform of the online compiler. This requires 3 important things: the text area for text editors, the submit button and finally the output section. For the text editors, we may not follow up on this tutorial. Instead of that, we will use the open sources called “CodeMirror”
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                About the CodeMirror, CodeMirror is the text editor written by JavaScript for the browser. It is used for editing code and supports a range of programming languages
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                In this file, we will contain all the packages uses for the web application as showing below
                                <br />

                                Then, we will create an app variable for using express packages and body parse
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                And initialize the compiler option from the compilex package. Moreover, we have to link the ‘/’ root page with the index.file.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Then, we will make the condition by defining the post function to match the user’s option of the programming language that they want to compile.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                We then set the server’s port to listen and define the get function to print out the output data if the users execute the code
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Finally, we have to define another function to clean the memory and remove the temporary files after use

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            According to
                            <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-phpmysql-powered-forum-from-scratch--net-10188">“How to create a PHP/MySQL Powered Forum From Scratch”</a>, there will be 7 steps excluding the login and logout system
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 1:</b>Create the database table
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Besides creating the user’s table as we have done in the previous topic, we will create more 3 tables with the following attributes: categories(id, name, description), replies (id, content, date, topic, replied_by ) and topic (id, subject, date, id_categories, topic_by). After that, we will execute the queries on PHPMyAdmin
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\forum\18.png" />
                                <br />
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 2:</b> Create the categories

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                First, we use form tag to wrap the category session contains the categories selection and the text-area where users write
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\forum\5.png" />
                                <br />
                                Then, we will create a PHP script that checks if users have admin permissions to post and if they do, the form will display. Right after they finish write the content and click submit, the value will be saved as the MySQL queries execute
                                <br />

                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 3:</b> Adding the categories to index.php
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                First, we will display the categories table by using the select syntax to select the categories id, category name and the category description.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Then, we will use a bit help of PHP to display the results
                                <br />

                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 4:</b> Create the topic

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                First, we have to check if the users are already signed in and if they do, we show them the form
                                <br />

                                <br />
                                Secondly, we use the drop-down menu that selects the cat_id, cat_name, cat_des from the categories table
                                <br />

                                <br />
                                Thirdly, for making the processing saving part consist of two parts: saving the topic from the table and saving the first post in the first table. This called the transaction methods
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Fourthly, we create the queries that insert the topic_subject that users create into the topic table
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\forum\11.png" />
                                <br />
                                Fifthly, if we process the second query, this will insert the post that users create into the post table
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\forum\12.png" />
                                <br />
                                Finally, we combined all these codes.
                                <br />
                                <br />


                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 5:</b> Category view
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                In this session, we need to select two tables which are category and topic table and display it in the following order. For the category table the name of the category, categories description and for the topic table:  topic_id, topic_subject, topic_date.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Then, we used those queries in this completely category.php script. First, we will select the categories which match the users' choice. Check if we can get the categorise from it and if it does, display the data from categories and execute the queries
                                <br />
                                <br />

                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 6:</b> Topic View
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                To view, the topic, just as using the same methods as step 5: category view, we first select the topic_id and the topic_subject that match the id of the topic from database which users select
                                <br />

                                <br />
                                Now, we display all the post in the topic by executing the following queries
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\forum\16.png" />
                                <br />
                            </div>
                            <br />
                            <div>
                                <b>Step 7:</b>  Adding a reply
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                We first wrap the text-area where users put the comment and the submit button with form tags
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <img class="image-center" src="image\detail\forum\17.png" />
                                <br />
                                Then, we will check if it calls the file correctly and if it does check again if the users have already signed in. Finally, get the users’ replies and save it in the database.
                                <br />

                            </div>

                                First, we will reference academic books or quality courses that are created by top universities such as Oxford, Harvard, Stanford, etc. After searching, we will develop the content in the ways we think the users may easily understand, and all of this has to be in Vietnamese.
                            </div>

                                Then, we will ask someone who is an expert such as a professor in this field or anybody that we think is quality enough to look at the content and get the advice from them. This process may take a long time since we have to translate technical terms in English into Vietnamese or we have to define that in an understandable way.

                                We then negotiate and make sure for the companies that the people we introduce to them are qualified enough to work in their company since before getting connected to these companies, the users have to meet our standard (by passing the test or the interview, doing the project, etc). This requires us to make some commitments and paperwork.

This feature not only helps users to apply what they have learned but also to know their ability. Therefore, they can modify the study plan to develop themselves. Furthermore, the best thing about joining the competition is that users can expand their networking. They will know more people and learn new things from others.

                        Unfortunately, our knowledge and our skills are not wide enough to do that even though we have the source, the solution for each of the problems since we want to develop by ourselves so that if we debug or change the code, we know the right place to do that.

                <div>
                    For the last 4 weeks, there were several difficulties/dead-ends that we have faced:
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    After agreeing on the topic of our project (CodeX) and inputting hours of researching, we found out that we have some really strong competitors in this field, for example, Codelearn, a new web-based application developed by FPT that also provides coding and programing education in Vietnamese. By the time we knew about this problem, it was already too late to come up with a new project idea. The morale of the team went down a lot and it affected our performance. As the Team Leader, Tuan advised the group to continue on working on our project instead of sobbing on the situation. He said that it was actually a good thing for us since we could learn from what they did right and improved on what they failed to do.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    During our research and planning for the project, as a group, we agreed to have the Online Compiler as one of our main features for the website. We believed that providing users a place to practice what they learn right on the website was a big bonus to not only the experience of users, but also the long-term memory of that content. However, after further research, we understood that none of our team members was capable of programming and implementing this feature into our website. At the time, there were only 2 options for us, we can either learn to do it on our own time or hire some to do it for us. But our time and the fundings for this project are limited and we could not sacrifice them for the benefits of having the online compiler on our website. After all, we still need to focus on what matters, rather than trying to include everything we want for the project. So, we decided to push this feature back to the next phase of the project and gave room for other important features.
                </div>
                <br />
                <img class="image-center" src="image\plans\2.jpg" />
                <br />
                <div>
                    Through developing the idea for the project plan, there are two things that we changed. The first thing is the chat services. At first, we decided to make the chat box as an one-to-one interaction chat system like Messenger and WhatsApp where users can only chat with one person in a single chat box. Chatting with another person requires users to open another chat box.. However, after discussion, we decided to change it to an open chat box where everyone, who is online, can participate in the chat. Users can use this feature to share ideas, ask questions, and help each other by contributing to the open chat box. Since this chat box is available to everyone using CodeX, it is also important to have the chat box block out bad words and provide users with the permission to report. The ability to do so gives users a safer place for their education and improves the overall experience of all users.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    Secondly, we changed how assigned tasks and assignments will be graded. At first, we planned to deploy and use human-power to grade the exercise as it is important to have constructive feedback for our users so they can further develop their skills. This plan would work at the early stage of CodeX as there are not so many people using it. However, as the number of users increases, it will become impossible to deploy human-grading-style without breaking the bank. This is when automation becomes handy. As mentioned earlier, an online judge system will help us grade user’s tasks and assignments. Teachers or instructors will still be available to users to support and feedback, but it will be their responsibility to seek help in the first place. By doing so, we not only reduce the cost of human-labor, but also encourage users to engage in developing themselves.

                <b>Imagine the information that would be required if you were hand over at the end of semester to complete the job</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                <div>
                    First of all, the data that needs to be looked after when handing over the project is the Team Profile. The reason why is because every single project always contains the profile of the person of the team that makes it, this can also be used to avoid plagiarism. When you hand over your project without the ownership information, the others will think that you might have stolen it, or copy it somewhere else, or sometimes the person or the group that you trusted to hand your project over might change the ownership information of the project. Besides protecting the project ownership, acknowledging the trusted person's information as an exchange is very important because you have handed over all your efforts to them.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    Finally, making a compromise is a must-do thing when you pass the project. Especially information exchange, because you want to know everything that happens by the time a group oversees your project. It is very shortsighted of you when handing over the project without worrying for it. Furthermore, there might be some changes that may annoy or disappoint you, especially when the deadline is near, and you will not have time to fix the problems. So, when handing over your project, you must request the group or person that looks after your project to make a report every weekend, including things that they want to change or implement.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    Accepting the request to look after another person or group project is also very important. Although there are some similarities and relevance between handing over your project and receiving the project from others, in fact there is a difference when you take the project from another person or group as a request from them.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    To be concluded, the most crucial thing to implant into your mind when accepting to oversee another project is “Credibility”. Before explaining the importance of “Credibility”, there is a required information that must be reminded before accepting another project.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    The most crucial thing beside “Credibility” is exchanging information, and it always must do things. When accepting to look after another project, you must acquire the information of the person or the group that entrusted you the project as well as your information, this is a basic of equality in trade. Because when each side has acquired both of their team profile data, they will credit each other’s more.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                    Finally, when you receive another project, it is very important to check the trustworthiness or the credibility of the project data before working on it. The first reason is the ownership project profile might be changed by the time you received it or the profile might be an error. Because it is very dangerous when you complete the project and hand it out to the lecturer, if the lecturer finds out that the project was stolen from others, you might be in danger. The second reason is always checking the project data beside it profile, because sometimes people tend to forget to paraphrase the copied information from websites or E-books, this might result in a penalty and the project will be marked as plagiarism. So, it is your duty to check these all the way down before starting to work on the project.

Each lesson provides for the user a “Tutorial” lesson so the user can learn from the basic first, furthermore when the user finishes the tutorial, there will be some exercises to test the user, the “Exercise” section will appear when the user finishes the tutorial and there will be a bar called “Take the exercise” where user can practice what they have learned, the exercises will be ranked from easiest to hardest so the user can challenge themselves further. Therefore, if the user cannot understand or cannot solve the exercise, there will be a video which guides them on how to solve the question. The user can see the guide video by clicking on the “Guide” bar next to each exercise when clicking on the bar a video which is relevant to the exercise will show up.

                       The TAQ Team is a group of 3 first-year IT students with limited amounts of knowledge about coding and programming, especially the one needed to build the online interpreter. After carefully planning, we come up with 2 solutions, trying to learn it and do it ourselves or asking for help from a 3rd party company or coder. However, we need to deliver the “first batch” of the project in 3 months later, learning it and deploying it is not an option available as there is no time for us to do that. On the other hand, paying someone to code the online compiler and the online judge system for us is too expensive for a project like this, where the fundings is limited.

                       As CodeX is a new self-learning website about coding/programming for Vietnam users, providing good post-study services like recruitment for users is completely impossible. It is hard to get sponsors and connections from companies when our web-based application gets released the first time. Companies, vendors, and other organizations have better options when they want to seek for talents to recruit. Also, if our group wants to go out there and ask for sponsors, we need to develop a good plan and a promising proposal for those companies. In the next 3 months, as we can only focus on the core of CodeX, we simply do not have enough time to do it.

                       Just like Recruitment Services, we want to use the next 3 months to focus on the core of CodeX and what matters the most. Hackathon or other competitions for users is simply not the option that we can choose.

               Although we want to include all these features into our web-based application CodeX, it is important to understand our position and know what the main focus is so we do not spend time trying to include everything and lowering the qualities and standards of the system. We believe that it is a good decision to put features aside for later days when CodeX is deployed to the market and ready for a bigger improvement.

The Ryzen 5 2600 CPU offers 6 main physical cores and 6 other virtual cores (12 threads). The performance of this CPU or more than enough for our office tasks and web programming. However, as Quynh may want to do some video rendering, we did some research and figured out that the Ryzen 5 2600, although not the strongest CPU out there with amazing performance, is reasonable and budget-friendly for video editing / rendering. Moreover, this CPU is unlocked. So, if we want to squeeze some extra performance from this chip, we have the ability to overlock it, under our risks of damaging it..

                           For recent years, 16GB of RAM has, somewhat, become the norm for a decent and reliable PC. As a PC lover, Tuan has to go out of his way to fulfil the checklist of 16GB of RAM before anything else. The more RAM we have, the more space our PC has to work with before choking itself. As coding / programming a functional program is extremely resource-hungry, we do not want to limit our abilities to the availability of our RAM.

                           Another good factor of RAM is how fast it runs; in this case, our RAM’s speed is 2666Mhz. The faster the RAM’s speed is, the lesser the time it takes for the CPU to access the stored information.

                           Just like our selection for the CPU section, we chose AMD RX 570 4GB as our main GPU for the system. The AMD RX 570 4GB is also a mid-tier graphic card with decent performance, but with an affordable price. The power of GPU shines the most during video editing where the actual video has to be displayed on the timeline for editing. This will help us in reducing the time it takes for video editing.

His knowledge and experience about PC components and PC building have improved significantly. Before every build, he has to do a lot of research to find suitable components for not only the needs of the users, but also future upgrade paths. The current system used for the project is actually his own personal computer that he built about a year ago. As the project continues and thrives, we also plan to upgrade to a more powerful machine to handle the job, and we trust him and his experience on this matter.

Therefore,  not only he had experiences in HTML, CSS, Javascript, but also PHP and MySQL. Firstly, he used HTML(build up a basic format for website), CSS(to customize font, margin, padding, colour, the position of the elements,etc.) and Javascript (build the function to calculate the ticket’s price, the function to make the images automatically switch to others) to develop the cinema website. Then he used PHP to connect to a database of customers which he created by using MySQL. For Ky Anh, just like Quynh, he just knows HTML, CSS and Javascript, the website he had developed is here.

               The project of the TAQ Team is about creating a web-based application, named CodeX, to provide an online learning space about coding, coding language, and programming for mainly Vietnamese users. According to Software Testing Help, web application testing has 6 major checklists and each checklist focuses on a different area of the web application [1]. Here are the 6 checklists for web application testing:
           </div>
           <ul>
               <li>
                   Functionality Testing
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
               <li>
                   Usability Testing
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
               <li>
                   Interface Testing
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
               <li>
                   Compatibility Testing
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
               <li>
                   Performance Testing
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
               <li>
                   Security Testing
                   <br />
                   <br />
               </li>
           </ul>
           <br />
           <img class="image-center" src="image\testing\4.png" />
           <br />
           <div>
               For the testing of our project, we will base this guideline to test it thoroughly. For example, in Functionality Testing, one of the required tasks is to double-check and ensure that all the links and inter-connections between pages are working accordingly [1]. Another good example is user’s navigation when using the website. In Usability Testing, the layout of the web application dictates how users will interact and navigate through it [1].
           </div>
           <br />
           <div>
               When the actual testing takes place, these guidelines have an important role in letting us know when the project has succeeded; it can be either the whole project, or even a small requirement in any of the 6 checklists above. As founders and creators, we, as a group, can also develop a set of standards and requirements of our own for our CodeX project. For example, one of the focuses for CodeX is providing coding/programming education in Vietnamese for the Vietnamese. We might set our goal to have the web application written with the percentage of 75% covered in Vietnamese. However, even if we succeed in this task, it does not mean that the whole project will be a complete success. These guidelines, standards, or requirements still only serve parts of the whole picture as there are many other variables that can affect the actual outcome of the project, especially those our group cannot predict and foresee.
           </div>
           <br />
           <div>
               In our testing, depending on the state of the project, prototypes and demos might be used as the testing tools to gain better and deeper feedback. Prototypes and demos can be produced specifically for a certain task/requirement. For example, if we want to test the effectiveness and efficiency of our web application’s interface, we can have the Designer design the layout of the website and use Adobe XD or Photoshop to illustrate the idea and how it actually looks before deploying it.
           </div>
           <br />
           <div>
               Speaking of user testing, it is also important to have a clear plan on how we find our test users and how they are qualified. Since all the team members are currently studying at RMIT University Vietnam, we can ask students and staff at the university to help us with the user testing. Before the actual testing, we need to do some surveys on our test users to get their background and other related information. This helps us classify them into sub-groups, which may have different characteristics and considerations from the main population. For the main population, we plan to increase the size of our test users’ base as the project progresses (around 10 to 20 people for the first batch of our prototype). We choose to do this because we want to limit the number of input feedbacks from test users during the early stage of the project, where it is still vague and undecided in terms of overall experience. This helps us in focusing on what matters and what we have set out to do instead of thinking and worrying about what test users want based on their personal experience at the early stage. It is important to note that this does not mean the feedback from test users are not important for the development of our project.

               During the process of building a website, there might be some risk. The first risk is that for developing some features for CodeX, we have to use some languages programming which are hard to learn or we have not faced before. For example, if we develop an online interpreter, we have to use Nodejs which nobody in my group has learned. The second risk is that there are not enough resources to build up the features for the website, For example, while researching how to develop the online tool judgement, there is no document that guides us to do that instead of the open-source code. Aside from the technical issues, we might face problems related to human factors. Since our project needs the team members to put a lot of effort to do and the work keeps increasing in their head. Some people may lose their spirit and procrastinate which reduces working efficiency. The result of this might be that our project would never be done.

           <img class="image-center" src="image\risk\1.jpg" />
           <div>
               Another risk that can be foreseen is coding/programming the web application CodeX as a group. Although we have Github and Atom to manage our codes and how it should be committed to keeping the integrity of the program, different coding and programming styles can lead to bugs that are so hard to trace out. That is why companies always have coding guidelines or rules to shape their employees’ coding styles under the same structure. Professor Tran Ngoc Quang also talked about this solution during our interview with him for Assignment 2. Our group also plans to have a coding guideline for our own project if this project hits its next phase.

       <section class="grid-item2">
           <div>
               Group communication is very important when doing our group project. It could help the project to be more efficient. When doing this group project, communication is unavoidable in order to perfect the project.

This resulted in that when there are any lessons, the whole group will meet directly at the classroom, this was very convenient because the group does not have to schedule for the meeting, in fact the whole group can meet each other after class. Moreover, due to the current situation worldwide, personal issues as well as participating in other courses, the group has to minimize the meeting time at school. Therefore, the group decided to start a meeting via Team software more frequently. Twice a week including the weekend, besides meeting at the classroom the TAQ’s team will schedule and decide which day they will start the meeting online and which time the team will be most flexible to meet online. Furthermore, the meeting also took place outside the school. Nevertheless, each meeting will take approximately 2 hours at the maximum and half an hour if there are not any crucial things to discuss. The scheduled meeting for the whole week will be divided consecutively.

               From Monday to Wednesday, the TAQ’s team will meet at school face-to-face. From Thursday to Sunday, the meeting will be held online or at some working place such as a coffee shop. The team leader will announce to the group via text on Messenger when there is any meeting deadline is coming so every member will have time to prepare and notice.

               If a member cannot attend the meeting, the person who is absent has to inform the leader the reason for not participating in the meeting. After the meeting, the absent member will be announced by the team leader or other member via text or phone call on which sections or tasks they have to work on.
