    <p class="grid-item2 text-center" style="width:50%;align-content:center; justify-content:center;margin-left:325px;">Our team believes that knowledge only comes to those who seek it and asking questions is the first step toward erudition. By combining the first letter of our team members’ first names (T for Tuan, A for Anh, and Q for Quynh), we have TAQ, our team name, which also stands for “Time to Ask Questions”. The spirit behind this name is to promote and encourage others to be curious and not afraid to ask questions because that is when they have the potential to master what they want to learn.</p>

                    I am Nguyen Thanh Tuan, a member of the TAQ team and a current student at RMIT University Vietnam. My student number is 3836455. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city. In 2014, I travelled to the United States of America for higher education. However, things didn't go as planned so I came back and applied to RMIT University Vietnam to continue my studies. I am majoring in Information Technology. I actually studied Business for a while when I was living in the States. During that time, my host family sparkled the love of IT in me when he taught and guided me through the process of building my own computer. After my first build, I decided to officially switch my major to IT and dig deeper into it. I figured out that I am really into Networking, Cyber Security, and Database/Server. Although I don’t have a lot of experience in the IT field beside some knowledge about computers, and codings, I am eager to learn more and make a career out of it, or even a business. During my free time, I love to hang out with friends; it can be anything from getting a cup of coffee, travelling with our bikes, or even playing video games together.

                <p class="text-center">
                    My name is Ky Anh, member of the TAQ team, first year student of RMIT in Saigon campus and my major is IT. Therefore, I was studying International Business at Hanoi campus. When finishing the first semester, I found out that business doesn't suit me well so I changed the course. Having known that I had interest in technologies and the Internet, I decided to move to Saigon campus without hesitation. In the Information Technology area, things that attract me the most are Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Technologies. Furthermore, when seeing these things, the first thought in my mind is “what features does it have and what can it do?”. I always wanted to try new technologies not with speech from the others but by my own hands, because by interacting directly with these technologies I can easily memorize their features and how to manipulate them. Nevertheless, besides the love for technologies, I also have some IT experience when I have not graduated from my high school. At this time, the school itself has organized a science fair at the school hall. This fair includes all students from different ages to participate, by forming in a group of 5 members and creating an invention of their own, this could be anything but most students chose to make a robot instead. Therefore, our group has invented a robot that can pick up items by using a controller but unfortunately it only can move around but cannot pick up items nearby.

                   Hi , My name is Quynh but you can also call me Lam, I am a freshman at RMIT and my student ID is s3836322. I am the third member of the TAQ team. So let's talk a little bit about myself. Firstly, I was born on a very--very special day, which is Women's National Day. Sadly, I just have one gift on this day. Secondly, as you can see in my name, I was born in Vietnam. However, I can speak English too thanks to my parents because they made me learn English at a very young age. Thirdly, there is one fun fact about me : my brother and also my cousins used to call me “Quan”, which means trouser in Vietnamese, because my name has a similar pronunciation. Moreover, in my free time, I love reading books and learning new things in different aspects such as marketing, business, etc. If you ask what my interest in IT is, it is definitely AI. I have a huge passion for AI because I am a lazy person and with the help of AI, my work will be completely faster and more efficient. To make my dream come true, I have studied some courses relevant to AI and machine learning on LinkedLearn. Moreover, I have attended many classes to learn about algorithms and data structure. Furthermore, to expand my knowledge in this field, I have read many books relevant to to AI, machine learning and data

           In general, our group did fine when working together in Assignment 2. Here are some good tactics in Assignment 2, that are used again in the Assignment 3:
       </div>
       <br />
       <div>
           <b>Subjective:</b>
       </div>
       <ul>
           <li>
               Schedule bonding time to let team members understanding each others and helps them get out of their “comfort zone”, so the team can maximize the outcome of the project
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>

           <li>
               Letting members choose their tasks before assigning them.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               Getting to know other members’ schedules and their life outside of school work to sympathize and support if bad things happen.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
       </ul>
       <div>
           <b>Objective:</b>
       </div>
       <ul>
           <li>
               The tasks are split and assigned equally and fairly among team members.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>

           <li>
               Each task will have its own deadline as we also consider the workload of each task differently.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               The deadlines are set a little sooner than when they should be to create courage for team members to finish the task and also give them the feelings they have extra time in case the deadlines are not met.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               Each task will be assigned based on team members’ skills, experiences, and knowledges about that tasks
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>

           <li>
               One can join and support other team members on a task if they want to learn more about that particular task.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               When finished, tasks are reviewed by other members to not only improve the quality of the finished tasks, but also its synergy with others’ works.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
       </ul>
       <div>
           On the other hand, we also have some bad practices that need to be fixed. Here are those bad practices and our solutions:
       </div>
       <br />
       <div>
           <b>Subjective:</b>
       </div>
       <ul>
           <li>
               Miscommunications happened due to busy schedules, which resulted in stress and delays - Spending more time checking on each other to minimize miscommunications.
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>
           <li>
               Procrastination happened due to many reasons - Schedule working time offline so all members can gather together and encourage each other to work
               <br />
               <br />
           </li>

On the other hand, Quynh’s ideal job - AI/Data Mining Developer requires her to “perform functional analysis, application design, development, unit test, deployment and maintenance”. Despite the differences, our group believes that data is the common element between Tuan and Quynh’s jobs.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data is involved heavily in both Tuan and Quynh’s jobs. As a Database Administrator, Tuan has to work a lot with data since it is his job to keep the company’s database performing sufficiently to “ensure the availability and consistent performance of our corporate applications”
                   . On the other hand, as a AI/Data Mining Developer, Quynh needs the data to perform her tasks as data is important for AI to train test units or models. In other words, Tuan keeps the database functional for Quynh, so she can use the data for her AI’s tasks.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, one could say that Tuan and Anh’s jobs have a common background. Since both Tuan (Database Administrator) and Anh (System Developer) are required to maintain, improve and troubleshoot the system they are assigned to; they are, technically, doing the same job but in different segments of IT, with different focuses.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Assignment 2, none of our team members change their ideal jobs. Despite the fact that most of our team members’ ideal jobs are not in the top demanding jobs and other criterias, we chose those ideal jobs as we have a passion in those particular fields and we also want to build our careers relating to those jobs. So, it is important to work a couple years in these positions and gain enough experiences and confidence before setting foot into building our careers. Not only that, these jobs can also be a testing place for us to test ourselves to make sure that we are passionate and determined enough for the actual investment in those fields.

               <p class="text-center">
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Tuan, with his interest in Networking, Database, and Cyber Security, within the next 5 years, he plans to study on his own thoroughly most of the coding languages for those fields like C, C++, Java, Python, and so on. He also plans to intern at relevant companies to strengthen his skills and experiences. If possible, he also wants to get his Master’s degree right after he graduates from RMIT. After that, he would love to work for around 5 years with some self-study of general business/finance to prepare for the next big step. His biggest goal, at this moment, is to start up a cloud/server/database solution company with his best friend who is majoring in Finance and Logistics.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anh, he does not have a clear career plan for himself yet. At the moment, he wants to strengthen his coding skills with Java, Python, HTML, and CSS within the next 5 years. He also wants to study Linux and Windows Server. On the other hand, he plans to also study some business courses to improve his skills in finance.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Quynh sets her goals to be an expert in the field of AI/Machine Learning. She plans to apply for an internship during her second year of internship to gain more experiences. She is also in the progress of self-study of AI, Machine Learning, and AWS on LinkedLearn. She wants to gain enough knowledge and experiences to start researching furthermore on the topic of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning with a focus on some topics like facial recognition/detection, AI chat bot, and so on.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up the analysis for our group’s career plans, each of us has our own plans and paths for the future. At the present, since our group’s members are still in our first or second year in college, it is certain that we still have a lot to learn and experience to prepare for whatever we plan in the future, at least for the next 2 to 3 years. After this period, it is when the difference starts to kick in. For Anh, he isn’t sure about what he wants to do next, after his college life. For Tuan, he wants to start up a company with his friend that provides cloud/server/database solutions for others; while, on the other hand, Quynh wants to go deeper into the field of AI/Machine Learning.
                   <br />
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Assignment 2, most of the team members from the TAQ Team still stay with their original career plans. For example, Tuan still aims to open a Database/Servers solution company or anything similar in that field, with his best friend. However, he is now aware more about the presence of BlockChain and other jobs related to his IT interest, like Data Analyst, or Business Intelligence. He said that he would look into those things when he had the time. For Quynh, she still stays with her IT interest in Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence. Lastly, for Anh, he is still undecided on his career paths in the future. However, he knows he likes what he is studying now.
