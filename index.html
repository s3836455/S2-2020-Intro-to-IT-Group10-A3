    </h2>
    <p class="grid-item2 text-center" style="width:50%;align-content:center; justify-content:center;margin-left:325px;">Our team believes that knowledge only comes to those who seek it and asking questions is the first step toward erudition. By combining the first letter of our team members’ first names (T for Tuan, A for Anh, and Q for Quynh), we have TAQ, our team name, which also stands for “Time to Ask Questions”. The spirit behind this name is to promote and encourage others to be curious and not afraid to ask questions because that is when they have the potential to master what they want to learn.</p>

                    I am Nguyen Thanh Tuan, a member of the TAQ team and a current student at RMIT University Vietnam. My student number is 3836455. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city. In 2014, I travelled to the United States of America for higher education. However, things didn't go as planned so I came back and applied to RMIT University Vietnam to continue my studies. I am majoring in Information Technology. I actually studied Business for a while when I was living in the States. During that time, my host family sparkled the love of IT in me when he taught and guided me through the process of building my own computer. After my first build, I decided to officially switch my major to IT and dig deeper into it. I figured out that I am really into Networking, Cyber Security, and Database/Server. Although I don’t have a lot of experience in the IT field beside some knowledge about computers, and codings, I am eager to learn more and make a career out of it, or even a business. During my free time, I love to hang out with friends; it can be anything from getting a cup of coffee, travelling with our bikes, or even playing video games together.
